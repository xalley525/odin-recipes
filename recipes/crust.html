    <h1>All Butter Pie Crust</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    
    <p>A simple, four ingredient pie crust that bakes up to crisp, flakey perfection.</p>
    <p>When making a custard based pie (such as a pumpkin or pecan pie) it's best to blind bake your crust before adding the filling. This helps prevent the bottom of the crust from coming out soggy and undercooked. The steps for blind baking are listed after the recipe.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 frozen butter (one half stick)</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>2-4 tbs ice water (more may be needed depending on humidity)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine flour and salt in a large bowl</li>
        <li>Using a box grater, grate frozen butter into the flour mixture</li>
        <li>Gently combine with clean hands</li>
        <li>Add water one tablespoon at a time, mixing between additions.(<strong>It's important to only add as much water as it takes for the dough to come together! Too much water will lead to a soggy crust.</strong>)</li>
        <li>Shape the dough into a rough ball and return to the refrigerator for 30 minutes to an hour</li>
        <li>After chilling, turn the dough ball out onto a floured surface and roll into a thin disk a few inches larger than your pie dish</li>
        <li>Gently transfer rolled crust into pie dish, taking care not to trap air pockets under the crust</li>
        <li>Trim excess dough from around the edges of the dish and crimp using your prefered method (I use my knuckles)</li>
        <li>Return crust to refrigerator to chill before baking</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>To Blind Bake</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425</li>
        <li>Using a fork, prick the bottom of the pie crust</li>
        <li>Gently press parchment paper into the pie dish, making sure it's flush with the crust</li>
        <li>Fill the pie with pie weights (I use dry beans)</li>
        <li>Place pie on a cookie sheet and transfer to the oven</li>
        <li>Bake for 10-15 minutes, or until the edges of the crust are just beginning to brown</li>
        <li>Remove parchment paper and pie weights from crust and return to oven for another 10-15 minutes, or until crust is browned and cooked through</li>
        <li>Allow crust to cool completely before filling</li>
    </ol>
