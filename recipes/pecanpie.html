        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is my favorite pecan pie recipe. It's involved and time consuming, but it's completely worth it. My family insists that I make this pie every year for Christmas and Thanksgiving, and there's rarely any left the next day!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>One disk prepared pie dough (<a href="crust.html">This</a> is my prefered recipe.)</li>
            <li>1 cup maple syrup</li>
            <li>3/4 cup brown sugar</li>
            <li>3 tbs butter</li>
            <li>1/4 cup bourbon</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>3 eggs (at room temperature)</li>
            <li>1 1/2-2 cups pecans (I prefer chopped, but halved is traditional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350</li>
            <li>In a small saucepan, whisk together maple syrup and brown sugar over low to medium heat until brown sugar is fully dissolved.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat and whisk in butter, bourbon, and vanilla. Set aside to cool.</li>
            <li>When the mixture has fully cooled, lightly beat in eggs until fully blended. It's important that the mixture has fully cooled before adding the eggs, otherwise they will curdle and you'll have to start over.</li>
            <li>Pour pecans into blind baked pie shell, ensuring they form an even layer that fully covers the bottom</li>
            <li>Slowly pour filling mixture over pecans</li>
            <li>Bake for 40-45 minutes, rotating the pie halfway through cook time. The pie is set when the edges are firm and the center is slightly jiggly</li>
            <li>Remove from oven and place on a rack to cool</li>

        </ol>
